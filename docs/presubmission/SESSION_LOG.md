# Session log — pre-submission programme

One entry per session, appended at the end of the session, in the template of `PLAN.md` §1.4.
The last entry is the start gate for the next session: it must be the previous session with
`status: COMPLETE`, or the same session with `PARTIAL` or `BLOCKED` when resuming.

(the commit carrying this entry) [S0] Session log: S0 complete
Done:
- Item 1: working tree clean at da74907; tagged `pre-presubmission` (local only); created branch `presubmission`.
- Item 2: `SESSION_LOG.md`, `DECISIONS_FOR_USER.md`, `OUT_OF_SCOPE.md` and `FILE_MAP.md` created; `PLAN.md` placed here as its preamble directs (byte-identical to the supplied copy); `docs/presubmission/sources/` git-ignored (verified with `git check-ignore`).
- Item 3: `FILE_MAP.md` covers every entry S0 lists. Two read-only Explore agents (Sonnet; the plan's limit is two) gathered them; every cited file:line was then re-read, and four wrong line numbers were corrected.
- Item 4: section map of all 42 headings, with per-heading word counts, in `FILE_MAP.md` §13. Before figures for item 7: `PAPER.md` body (§1 to "Data and code", which is §13 in the PDF) **27,387 words**, total **31,825**. The template has 25,880 and 29,340. The count command is in `FILE_MAP.md` §13.
- Item 5: baseline recorded in `BASELINE_S0.md`. Nothing fixed.
- Findings later sessions need, all in `FILE_MAP.md`:
  - **No shared cluster-bootstrap function exists** (23 scripts define their own). S1's rule text and S2a must name the one they use; the precedent is `scripts/a1_ab_by_horizon.py:118-134`.
  - No local copies of arXiv 2501.10100 or 2504.16680 exist, so S1 downloads them.
  - `step5_train.py` has no M or N flag, and `WINDOW = 40` sits at `src/rwm_train.py:23`.
  - No thread settings exist anywhere (torch default; the timing artifact records 2).
  - Early `step5_*.json` artifacts lack the width field.
  - Appending a ledger entry requires updating `RESULTS.md`'s count table in the same commit.
  - Both bundle builders ship `docs/presubmission/` (`OUT_OF_SCOPE.md`, first line). This matters for S3's author query and S11's deny-list scan.
Build/checks: pass. The fast build, 8 prose checks and gates, and a second build ran at the start and again at the end; every generated text output was byte-identical to the committed tree both times, and the PDF differs only in its date and /ID. `submission_check` 20/22 (E7 and C1, known). `part_f_gate` passes the 7 checks it runs; check 4 needs a clone, and the committed record keeps it failing on 365, as published.
Paper numbers changed: none
CPU jobs over 1 min: none (each build-and-check pass took about 50 s)
Next: S1 (Opus 5.5, high effort). Read `PLAN.md` §1, S1 and Appendix C, plus `FILE_MAP.md`. Next free ledger IDs: M-74, S-20, R-76.
Decisions for user: none. Push ruling given in chat on 2026-09-28: "Push the branch now" (branch `presubmission` only; tag `pre-presubmission` stays local).
